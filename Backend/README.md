Welcome to the Smart Contract folder of the Sirius Web3 Crypto Payment project! This README provides an overview of the smart contract implementation, which enables secure and decentralized crypto payments.

#Overview

The Smart Contract folder contains the following subfolders and files:

contracts: This folder contains the Solidity smart contract code, including the Transactions.sol file.
scripts: This folder contains scripts for deploying and interacting with the smart contract.
tests: This folder contains tests for the smart contract, ensuring its functionality and security.
Transactions.sol

The Transactions.sol file is the core of the smart contract implementation. It defines a contract that enables users to make crypto payments and stores transaction data on the blockchain. The contract includes the following functions:

makePayment: Allows users to make a payment to another user.
getTransaction: Retrieves a transaction by its ID.
getTransactionCount: Returns the total number of transactions.
The contract uses OpenZeppelin's ERC20 token standard to manage token transfers and balances.

Scripts

The scripts folder contains scripts for deploying and interacting with the smart contract. These scripts are written in JavaScript and use the ethers.js library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

deploy.js: Deploys the Transactions contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
interact.js: Interacts with the deployed contract, allowing users to make payments and retrieve transaction data.
Tests

The tests folder contains tests for the smart contract, ensuring its functionality and security. These tests are written in JavaScript and use the ethers.js library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

Transactions.test.js: Tests the makePayment function, ensuring that payments are processed correctly.
Transactions.test.js: Tests the getTransaction function, ensuring that transaction data is retrieved correctly.
Getting Started

To get started with the Smart Contract folder, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, run the following commands:

```shell
npm install
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
```

This will compile the smart contract and run the tests. You can then deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain using the deploy.js script.

Deployment

To deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain, run the following command:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

This will deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain and output the contract address.

Interacting with the Contract

To interact with the deployed contract, run the following command:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/interact.js
```

This will allow you to make payments and retrieve transaction data using the contract.
